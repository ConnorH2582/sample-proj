# sample-proj
Simple django project that manages events attended and contacts met.

App allows community admins to store, retrieve and list basic personal information about people they meet in their community events. They are able to save events they have attended, in order to remember where they met each person. Event data is a basic pair of:
● event name
● event date

Information about their peers includes:
● name
● email
● telephone number
● whether the person is a favorite contact

App is able to list existing stored person records, allows adding more event and person records, and provides the capability to search existing person records in order to find people by any matching search entry.
